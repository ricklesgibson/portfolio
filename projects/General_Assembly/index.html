					<h1>About</h1>
					<p> I'm an intellectually-curious person in his late 20's who recently moved to Santa Monica to enjoy the benefits of the city like cycling, yoga, great coffee & restaurants, and and engaged civil and business community. As someone who sees so much great cooperation and innovation in the area, I'd like to contribute to the growth and developmment of the community through technical and business projects. Solar energy, local water usage, IT development, and urban beautification are only a few of the hundreds of great projects being worked on now. 
					</p>
					<p> After finishing a physics degree and spending a few years exploring different lifestyle and career options, I'm looking forward to putting down some roots here and establishing myself as part of the community through service and innovation. Having overcome some challenges that seemed almost impossible at the time, I understand the value of tenacious persistence and how far a good team can go together.
